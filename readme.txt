IMPORTANT: Naming conventions for Android Studio Projects.
It is important that there be consistency for submission of android studio projects. Please use the following naming conventions.
1. For programming challenge(s), from the text, create one project for each problem. Give the project an intuitive name, for example, Chapter 2 Problem 23, is a programming challenge, create a project for this named "C2_P23"
2. For programming challenge(s) from worksheets, use the same approach. For Example Worksheet 3 Parts 3 and 4, respectively, use the names, "W3_P3", "W3_P4").
Just make things clear, if you need to, include a readme.txt that explains what the different files are in your submission. Keep it simple.
For the short answers and multiple choice simply include these in separate document, eg, assignment3.pdf, .assignment3.txt, whatever.
Zip everything up into a single file and submit to gradescope.
##
1. multiple-questions and writing-questions on worksheets goes to worksheet.txt
2. programming-code from text-book goes to C?_P#.Zip
3. programming-code from worksheet goes to W?_P#.Zip
we compress screenshots and code-files in the zip.
