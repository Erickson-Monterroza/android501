hi, I'm doing the firebase database.

I'm planning to store different object's data into the database.

For example, events detail, we need to store them in database.
For example, accounts info, we need to store them in database.

So, we need to do the UML thing. We need to draw what elements a specific object needs, for example: account needs: id, name, password, liked-events-id,......

After finishing this part, database can be created fluently!
