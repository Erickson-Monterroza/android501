hi, this is how i'm planning for the frontend:

Ericson and Ivan r gonna have the frontend thing.

First, u can choose whether or not to use agility development :)
If u guys find a perfect GitHub layout code, don't hesitate to share

Second, u need to decide what fragment u need, like, the bottom slide bar.

Third, u need to create a document file to point out the relationship between one view to the corresponding function, for example: event view -- onClick: start an activity with corresponding event detail.

Forth, the most important: life cycle. what is the lifecycle of each activity? what data do we need to store or restore in the lifecycle? Can u guys draw different graphs to show us the lifecycle? We will need this for final presentation.
